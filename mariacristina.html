      <p class="thetwin">The Twin Falls</p>
      <p class="desc1">Maria Cristina Falls is one of the most beautiful and<br> 
useful waterfalls in the Philippines. It’s a sight you<br> 
only see in the pages of the Sibika at Kultura (Hekasi)<br> 
books during the elementary days. But once you see<br> 
it in person, you will be awed by its imposing beauty.<br>
<br>
Located in Iligan City, Maria Cristina is nothing like the<br>
ordinary. Not only does it boast its glorious beauty, but <br>
it is also very valuable to the locals there. The 320-foot <br>
waterfall has a strong current that has been estimated to <br>
have a capacity of around 200 megawatts, that supplies <br>
70% of Mindanao’s electricity.<br><br>

Because of this, people can’t swim in the Maria Cristina<br> 
Falls. A visit here will not be a disappointment though <br>
because you can still admire it from afar, and just hop <br>
from one falls to another like the Tinago Falls. As you’d <br>
know, Iligan is home to many waterfalls, that’s why it’s <br>
called the “City of Majestic Waterfalls.” </p>

  <p class="visitw">Visit The Waterfalls</p>
  <p class="visitp">From Manila, you take a domestic flight to Cagayan de Oro City <br>
which arrives in Laguindingan International Airport, the nearest<br> 
airport in Iligan City. From Cagayan de Oro, take a jeepney <br>
going to Bulua Market Bus Terminal. <br><br>

After arriving at the bus terminal, ride the bus bound for Iligan City.<br>
From the terminal to Iligan, the travel time is approximately 2 hours.<br><br>

From the town proper, ride a jeep bound to Buru-an/Linamon and <br>
inform the driver to drop you off to a corner going to Maria <br>
Cristina Falls. From there, ride a motorcycle (habal-habal) to Agus <br>
River that costs about P60 to P80 per way. There are also taxis <br>
    available in the area if you want a more comfortable ride.</p>

  </p>
  <p class="reason1">Maria Cristina Falls is one my favorite tourist spot because it is memorable <br>
moment for me because we went there on a vacation and visited some <br>
places in Iligan city. I was intrigued how a waterfall were to be able <br>
to create electricity for the Mindanao and I’d like to see waterfalls in close up. <br>
    It has a natural beauty that is so relaxing to see for me and all the visitors.</p>
